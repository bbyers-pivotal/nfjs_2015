> I. Codebase
-- One codebase tracked in revision control, many deploys

---

> II. Dependencies
-- Explicitly declare and isolate dependencies

---

> III. Config
-- Store config in the environment

---

> IV. Backing Services
-- Treat backing services as attached resources

---

> V. Build, release, run
-- Strictly separate build and run stages

---

> VI. Processes
-- Execute the app as one or more stateless processes

---

> VII. Port binding
-- Export services via port binding

---

> VIII. Concurrency
-- Scale out via the process model

---

> IX. Disposability
-- Maximize robustness with fast startup and graceful shutdown

---

> X. Dev/prod parity
-- Keep development, staging, and production as similar as possible

---

> XI. Logs
-- Treat logs as event streams

---

> XII. Admin processes
-- Run admin/management tasks as one-off processes
